    `&                             {{The AND operator compares two bits and generates a result of 1 if both bits are 1; otherwise, it returns 0.}} 
    `|                             {{The OR operator compares two bits and generates a result of 1 if the bits are complementary; otherwise, it returns 0.}} 
    `^                             {{The EXCLUSIVE-OR operator compares two bits and returns 1 if either of the bits are 1 and it gives 0 if both bits are 0 or 1.}} 
    `~                             {{The COMPLEMENT operator is used to invert all of the bits of the operand.}} 
    `<<                            {{The SHIFT RIGHT operator moves the bits to the right, discards the far right bit, and assigns the leftmost bit a value of 0. Each move to the right effectively divides op1 in half.}} 
    `>>                            {{The SHIFT LEFT operator moves the bits to the left, discards the far left bit, and assigns the rightmost bit a value of 0. Each move to the left effectively multiplies op1 by 2.}} 
    `<<<                           {{The ZERO FILL RIGHT SHIFT operator moves a in binary representation bits to the right, discarding bits shifted off, and shifting in zeroes from the left. Note: This operator is only for JavaScript!}}
