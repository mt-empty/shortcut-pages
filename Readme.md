Currently the collection also includes non-GUI cheatsheets(extra):
* CLI tools
* Games
* Programming languages

All shortcut/cheatsheet pages were cloned from [DuckDuckgo repository](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies).


## Why shortcut
How many times did you have to use your mouse after installing the new shiny GUI application? 

You probably had to navigate a menu or look online for shortcuts.

Well you no longer have to, as you can get the shortcuts right from your terminal.

This project was started as an attempt to `Never leave my keyboard`, as well as a learning experience.
