## Why shortcut
How many times have you have you had to use you mouse after installing that new shiny GUI application? 
You probably had to look for shortcuts online.

Well you no longer have to, as you can get the shortcuts right from you terminal.

This project was started as an attempt to `Never leave my keyboard`, as well as a learning experience.
