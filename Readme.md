A collections of keyboard shortcuts for many GUI **application** and **websites**.

Currently the collection also includes non-GUI cheatsheats:

All cheatsheets have been cloned from [DuckDuckgo repostiory]().

## Why Cheatsheets
How many times have you have you had to use you mouse after installing that new shiny GUI application? 
You probably had to look for shortcuts online.

Well you no longer have to, as you can get the shortcuts right from you terminal.
