$ The Three States
    `Git Directory                 {{The .git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for the repository}} 
    `Working Directory             {{A copy of one version of the git project, taken from compressed database in the .git directory}} 
    `Staging Area/Index            {{File that stores information about what will next be committed into the git repository}} 

$ Configure Tooling
    `git config --global user.name "[name]"
>                                  {{Sets the name you want attached to your commit transactions}} 
    `git config --global user.email "[email address]"
>                                  {{Sets the email you want attached to your commit transactions}} 
    `git config --global color.ui auto
>                                  {{Enables helpful colorizations of command line input}} 

$ Create Repositories
    `git init [project-name]       {{Creates a new local repository with the specified name}} 
    `git clone [url]               {{Downloads a project and its entire version history}} 

$ Make Changes
    `git status                    {{Lists all new or modified files to be committed}} 
    `git diff                      {{Shows file differences not yet staged}} 
    `git add [file]                {{Snapshots the file in preparation for versioning}} 
    `git diff --staged             {{Shows file differences between staging and the last file version}} 
    `git reset [file]              {{Unstages the file, but preserves its contents}} 
    `git commit -m "[descriptive message]"
>                                  {{Records the file snapshots permanently in version history}} 

$ Group Changes
    `git branch                    {{Lists all local branches in the current repository}} 
    `git branch [branch-name]      {{Creates a new branch}} 
    `git checkout [branch-name]    {{Switches to the specified branch and updates the working directory}} 
    `git merge [branch]            {{Combines the specified branch's history into the current branch}} 
    `git branch -d [branch-name]   {{Deletes the specified branch}} 
    `git remote add [remote-name] [url]
>                                  {{Add a new remote git repository as a shortname}} 
    `git remote -v                 {{Lists all remote git repositories}} 

$ Refactor Filenames
    `git rm [file]                 {{Deletes the file from the working directory and stages the deletion}} 
    `git rm --cached [file]        {{Removes the file from version control but preserves the file locally}} 
    `git mv [file-original] [file-renamed]
>                                  {{Changes the file name and prepares it for commit}} 

$ Suppress Tracking
    `*.log build/ temp-*           {{A text file named .gitignore suppresses accidental versioning of files and paths matching the specified patterns}} 
    `git ls-files --other --ignored --exclude-standard
>                                  {{Lists all ignored files in this project}} 

$ Save Fragments
    `git stash                     {{Temporarily stores all modified tracking files}} 
    `git stash save [message]      {{Save local modifications to a new stash}} 
    `git stash pop                 {{Restores the most recently stashed files}} 
    `git stash list                {{Lists all stashed changesets}} 
    `git stash show                {{Show the changes recorded in the stash}} 
    `git stash drop                {{Discards the most recently stashed changeset}} 

$ Review History
    `git log                       {{Lists version history for the current branch}} 
    `git log --follow [file]       {{Lists version history for a file, including renames}} 
    `git diff [first-branch]...[second-branch]
>                                  {{Shows content differences between two branches}} 
    `git show [commit]             {{Outputs metadata and content changes of the specified commit}} 

$ Redo Commits
    `git reset [commit]            {{Undoes all commits after [commit], preserving changes locally}} 
    `git reset --hard [commit]     {{Discards all history and changes back to the specified commit}} 

$ Synchronize Changes
    `git fetch [bookmark] [branch] {{Downloads all history from the repository bookmark, optionally specifying branch}} 
    `git merge [bookmark]/[branch] {{Combines bookmark's branch into current local branches}} 
    `git push [alias] [branch]     {{Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub}} 
    `git push [alias] :[branch]    {{Deletes remote branch}} 
    `git pull                      {{Downloads bookmark history and incorporates changes}} 
    `git pull --rebase             {{Downloads bookmark history and incorporates your changes on top of remote changes}} 
    `git rebase --interactive --autosquash HEAD~N
>                                  {{Squash N last commits}} 
    `git cherry-pick -n <sha>      {{Cherry-pick a commit}} 
    `git revert -n <sha>           {{Revert a commit}} 

$ Debugging
    `git blame [file]              {{Show what revision and author last modified each line of a file}} 
    `git bisect                    {{Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug}}
