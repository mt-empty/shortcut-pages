$ Arithmetic Operators
    `+                             {{Adds two operands}} 
    `âˆ’                             {{Subtracts second operand from the first}}

    `>                             {{Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand}} 
    `<                             {{Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand}} 
    `>=                            {{Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand}} 
    `<=                            {{Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand}} 

$ Logical Operators
    `&&                            {{Logical AND operator}} 
    `||                            {{Logical OR Operator}}

$ Bitwise Operators
    `&                             {{Does the logical AND on the bits in the corresponding position of the operands in its binary form}} 
    `|                             {{Does the logical OR on the bits in the corresponding position of the operands in its binary form}} 
    `^                             {{Does XOR on the bits in the corresponding position of the operands in its binary form}} 
    `~                             {{Inverts all the bits of operand}} 
    `<<                            {{Takes two numbers, left shifts the bits of first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift}} 
    `>>                            {{Takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift}} 

$ Namespaces
    `namespace name ...            {{Define namespace for the enclosed code}}
