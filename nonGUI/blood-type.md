$ ABO blood group system
    `Group A                       {{Has only the A antigen on red cells (and B antibody in the plasma). Group A can donate red blood cells to Group A and Group AB.}} 
    `Group B                       {{Has only the B antigen on red cells (and A antibody in the plasma). Group B can donate red blood cells to Group B and Group AB.}} 
    `Group AB                      {{Has both A and B antigens on red cells (but neither A nor B antibody in the plasma). Group AB can only donate to Group AB, but can receive from all others, it is the universal recipient.}} 
    `Group 0                       {{Has neither A nor B antigens on red cells (but both A and B antibody are in the plasma). Group 0 can donate red blood cells to anybody, it is the universal donor.}}
