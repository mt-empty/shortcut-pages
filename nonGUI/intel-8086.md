>                                  {{This instruction loads new values into the specified register and into the DS register from four successive memory locations.}} 
    `LES - LES Register, Memory address of the first word
>                                  {{This instruction loads new values into the specified register and into the ES register from four successive memory locations}} 

$ Arithmetic Instructions
    `ADD Destination, Source       {{Adds the number in 'source' to the number in 'destination' and put the result in the 'destination'}}

    `MUL Source                    {{Multiplies an unsigned byte in the 'source' with an unsigned byte in AL register or an unsigned word in the 'source' with an unsigned word in AX register}} 
    `DIV Source                    {{Divide an unsigned word by a byte in the 'source' or to divide an unsigned double word by a word in the 'source'}}

    `ROL Destination, Count        {{Rotates all the bits in a word or byte  in the 'destination' to the left 'count' number of times. MSB is circled back into the LSB and CF contains a copy of the bit most recently moved out of the MSB}} 
    `ROR Destination, Count        {{Rotates all the bits in a word or byte  in the 'destination' to the right 'count' number of times. LSB is circled back into the LSB and CF contains a copy of the bit most recently moved out of the LSB}} 
    `SHL Destination, Count        {{Shifts each bit in the 'destination' to the left 'count' number of times and  a 0 is put in the LSB position for each shift}} 
    `SHR Destination, Count        {{Shifts each bit in the 'destination' to the right 'count' number of times and  a 0 is put in the MSB position for each shift}} 

$ Control Transfer Instructions
    `JMP Destination               {{Unconditional jump to the specified 'destination'}} 
    `JC Destination                {{Jump to the specified 'destination' if carry flag is set}} 
    `JZ Destination                {{Jump to the specified 'destination' if zero flag is set}}
