    `PokéStop                      {{A place in Pokémon GO where you can collect items, for example eggs and Poké Balls. PokéStops are indicated on your map with a blue icon}} 
    `Battle                        {{A battle at a friendly gym gives you experience points, needed for levelling up. A battle at a rival gym is a chance to take over and claim that gym. During a battle you can attack and dodge your opponent}} 
    `Gym                           {{Indicated as a large tower on your map, these are the only places where real battles can take place. You need to reach at least level 5 to use a gym}} 
    `CP                            {{CP, or combat power, gives your Pokémon strength for battles. CP can be increased by using candy or stardust to level-up or evolve your Pokémon}} 
    `HP                            {{HP, or hit points, are used during battles. You can regain them with potions}} 
    `XP                            {{XP, or experience points, are needed to level up. You can gain them by catching and evolving Pokémon}} 
    `Candy                         {{Needed to power-up and evolve your Pokémon. Candy can not be bought, it can only be obtained by catching or hatching Pokémon, or by transferring Pokémon to Professor Willow}} 
    `PokéCoins                     {{The in-game currency of Pokémon GO which is used to purchase items in the shop. PokéCoins can be purchased with real-world money or obtained by defending a gym}}

$ Tips
    `Concentrate on levelling-up   {{Especially at the beginning, trying to reach higher levels quickly will give you greater benefits, such as finding better Pokémon. See the "Key Levels" section for more benefits}} 
    `Wait for a Lucky Egg before evolving
>                                  {{Using a Lucky Egg will give you double XP and its effect lasts for 30 minutes. You can evolve up to about 60 Pokémon during this time which could give you thousands of extra XP in one go! So for maximum efficiency collect Pokémon and wait patiently for that Lucky Egg before you evolve them}} 
    `Get easy Pokémon to level up faster
>                                  {{The easiest Pokémon to evolve are Pidgey, Weedle and Caterpie as they only require 12 candy each. The next easiest Pokémon are 25-candy ones such as Rattata and Geodude}} 
    `Don't power-up Pokémon until level 20
>                                  {{As you increase levels you'll find better Pokémon, so it's not worth powering them up at the beginning. Concentrate on evolving them for more XP, ideally using a Lucky Egg}} 
    `Don't waste Poké Balls        {{Poké Balls are valuable so don't waste them on trying to catch awkward Pokémon, especially if they require a lot of candy, for example Zubats}} 
    `Consider getting a battery pack
>                                  {{Pokémon GO uses a lot of battery power so carrying a charged battery pack should prevent your phone dying while you're out and about}} 
    `Check your data plan          {{Pokémon GO also downloads a lot of data. If you're on a metered data plan, check your usage or cost before you spend too long playing the game}}
