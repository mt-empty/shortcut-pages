$ Exiled Great Houses
    `House Stark                   {{The former rulers of the North, ruling from the now sacked castle of Winterfell until the Red Wedding. The remaining Starks are scattered.}}

$ Extinct Great Houses
    `House Durrandon               {{Rulers of the Stormlands. Orys Baratheon, founder of House Baratheon, married the daughter of the last king of House Durrendon, thus House Baratheon descends from the Durrandons through the female line.}} 
    `House Gardener                {{Rulers of the Reach. House Tyrell claims descent from House Gardener through the female line, and House Florent is actually a cadet branch of House Gardener, with a better claim to rule based on lineage than the Tyrells. Several other Houses from the Reach also descend from House Gardener.}} 
    `House Hoare                   {{Rulers of the Iron Islands and (through conquest) the Riverlands. After their defeat, Aegon Targaryen commanded the ironborn to select a new family from among their number to rule over the rest, under the Targaryens. They selected House Greyjoy.}}
